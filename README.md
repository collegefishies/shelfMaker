# shelfMaker
It makes simple laser-cuttable shelves.

Please see the wiki. If for some reason it's not there, here's a plain text version.

Welcome to the shelfMaker wiki!

This program is designed to take in 5 parameters that describe your shelf, or divider box, if you're using this to sort the clothes in your drawers Marie Kondo style. The reason this is so nice is that it allows one to make shelves for happenstance cases. Like when you have some plywood that's of a different thickness than what you used last time. Or you have different sized electronics boxes this time.

## Dependencies

python 2.7

[dxfwrite 1.2.1](https://pypi.org/project/dxfwrite/) -- use `sudo pip install dxfwrite`

argparser

## Usage

Open up the folder that shelfMaker is in and run
`python shelfMaker -h` for instructions. It's a CLI interface.

## Useful Tips

Make a gauge bar yourself so you can ensure tight fits on your plywood pieces for easy assembly, when gluing or not gluing if the fit is good enough for your needs.
